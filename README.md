Simple JavaScript Calendar
==========================

This is a very bare bones calendar, designed to read from an ICS file and
display events coming in the next 60 days.

It is in use on the [Brisbane Area WICEN Group](https://brisbanewicen.org.au)
website, where you can see it under the "Events this month".
